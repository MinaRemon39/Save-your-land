This process enables real-time tracking of soil health, allowing farmers and agricultural systems to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and crop management. Ultimately, the integration of such smart technologies contributes to more sustainable and efficient farming practices by ensuring that every piece of land receives the care it specifically needs.",
